Hi Team,

As you may already know, today is my last day of work at Vanguard!
Not only was it a wonderful learning experience for me, but I also had a very good time working with the team during my work tenure.
I would like to thank you all for your guidance and support. I wish you all continued success in Vanguard endeavors and the time to enjoy in life!
Vanguard should do more to retain the talent, don't take serious just kiddin!

With Best Regards,

I’m retiring and today is my last day at Vanguard!
I am thankful for the opportunity to have been part of the Vanguard crew for almost 20 years.  
During these years I met so many remarkable people and I am grateful for their help, support and friendship.   
Good luck to all of you in your future careers and in life.

Today is my last day at Vanguard. It's hard to believe, but I have been in Retail for almost 25 years!

Vanguard is filled with talented and dedicated people. Over the years I have had the pleasure to work directly with 
or benefit from the expertise of so many of you. So before I go, thank you for whatever part you played
in making Vanguard a most enjoyable place for me to pursue my career!  I will miss the camaraderie of my past and present teammates, but I
have many great memories to take with me.

I wish you all continued success in Vanguard and the time to enjoy life's non-work related adventures!

Hi all, I came down with something over the weekend.  I'm feeling pretty low, so I'm going to take the day off.

Thank you,

Hi all, I need to take another day off.  I have the flu and fighting a fever, so still really out of it.

Thank you,
